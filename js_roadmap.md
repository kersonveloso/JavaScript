## High order array functions

- [ ] Filter()
- [ ] Map()
- [ ] Reduce()
- [ ] Sort()

## Concept of components & state

## JavaScript Framwork / Libary
- [ ] JQuery
  - [ ] 1. Selectors
  - [ ] 2. API functions
    - [ ] a) find(): Selects elements based on the provided selector string
    - [ ] b) hide(): Hides an element if it was visible
    - [ ] c) show(): Shows an element if it was hidden
    - [ ] d) html(): Gets or sets an inner HTML of an element
    - [ ] e) append() Injects an element into the DOM after the selected element
    - [ ] f) prepend() Injects an element into the DOM before the selected element
    - [ ] g) on(): Attaches an event listener to an element
    - [ ] h) off() Detaches an event listener from an element
    - [ ] i) css(): Gets or sets the style attribute value of an element
    - [ ] j) attr() Gets or sets any attribute of an element
    - [ ] k) val(): Gets or sets the value attribute of an element
    - [ ] l) text(): Gets the combined text of an element and its children
    - [ ] m) each(): Iterates over a set of matched elements
- [ ] Vue
  - [ ] 1. Official Documentation are the Bomb! - Look at official style guide and Enterprise Boilerplate
  - [ ] 2. Testing - Vue Test Utils, use Jest or Mocha, Validation!
  - [ ] 3. Vue UI / Vue CLI - GUI and tooling for building app
  - [ ] 4. Learn Props - passing data into components
  - [ ] 5. Vuex - global state management
  - [ ] 6. Function Components - special SFCs `<template functional>...</template>`
  - [ ] 7. Render function - `render(h) { return h(...) }`
  - [ ] 8. Lazy Loading Routes - decreases bundle size
  - [ ] 9. Computed Properties - cached, updated only when needed
  - [ ] 10. Cool Vue Projects - Gridsome, VuePress, Vuetify, Nuxt, Vuelidate/Veevalidate, and more
- [ ] React
- [ ] Node
- [ ] Express
